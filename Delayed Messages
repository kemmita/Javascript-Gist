//below we create a delayed welcome message using a new variable and setting it to another JS function setTimeout we then used a window 
alert to display the message and 3000 mila seconds as to keep the message from popping up right away, so three seconds after they arrive
the message will pop up.

var delayedWelcome = setTimeout(function(){window.alert("Welcome to our page")}, 3000);
