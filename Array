//below we create an array of numbers and we would like it to appear as ages, so wee need to place the word "Age" on the top and have 
our array print below. to do this simply place += "<br />"+ between innerHTML and the name of the array

from the array.

place value we with to print, this is what x was above in our function.

such ease as shown below.

the item you want to delete and then add a comma with the number 1 which represents how many items you want to delete 
from that specific place holder.

//here we our adding an item to the list so use array name followed by the keyword splice again and then within the parameter area 
declare the place holder you want to add to and the second number you add will be 0 as you are adding data here, not deleting after 
that you can add as many pieces of data that you see fit!
