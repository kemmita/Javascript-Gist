1. variables can be declared using var or let, let is for local variables and var is for global variables. You can also use 
const for variables that will have no value changed in the future.

let name = 'Russell Kemmit';
var bName = 'Jane Kemmit';
const bDay = '11/11/1982';
console.log(bDay);
