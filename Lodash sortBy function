1. Using sortBy. we pass the array as the first param follwed by the row of data we wish to sort by
numbers = [[1,23],[3,98],[2,33]];
const sorted = _.sortBy(numbers, (row) => row[1]);

2. If we had a single single row array to sort, we would no supply the second param.

const nummer = [1,5,2,6,7,3];
console.log(_.sortBy(nummer))
