<!--we only needed to create a paragraph becuase we need one to use input tags make sure to use the correct type for input as you can see 
below we used number as we are chgecking for speed limits here. and then perhaps the most important part, the button was nested within the 
paragraph tags after the input tags. inside the first button tag use the onclick html method and then place the name of the function we 
created in our JS file within the parenthesees. So when the button is clicked, the function will execute.-->

JS**********************************************
//first thing to do is to create a function and we named it checkSpeed we then created a variable speed and we will obtain this speed 
from an input tag we created on our html page and gave it the id speed after speed write .value
function checkSpeed() {
    var speed = document.getElementById("speed").value;
if (speed>70) {
    window.alert("you are going to fast");
}else if(speed<40){
    window.alert("your speed is too slow.");
}
else{
    window.alert("your speed is fine.")
}
