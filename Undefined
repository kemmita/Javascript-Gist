1.undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. On the other hand, null 
is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.


// We would not be  able to use null for the if statement below as we have declared the variable, but hva enot assigned it a value.

const products = [];
const product = products[0];


if(product === undefined){
    console.log('nothing there');
}else{
    console.log(`${product} was found.`);
}
