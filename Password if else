<!--Below we create a paragraph and use input tag to create an area where users can type data. we give input an id as we will be using 
that in our JS function to check if the password is correct. we then add a button inside of the paragraph and give it no id but set it 
to onclick where it will execute our function when clicked. make sure to add the circle braces after function name as I forgot and it 
did not work at first. -->
        <p><input id="password" type="password"><button onclick="checkPass()">Please Enter Password</button></p>
<!--notice below I created a paragraph but left it empty but still gave the paragraph an id that is becuase it will remain blank untill 
the password is tested.-->

JS****************************************************
//the first line of code is the most important as we need to create a variable that takes on the life of the input id we created on the 
html page and set it to value so now we have a variable that is used on the html input and will take the value of what is enetred for 
input. we then create a simple if statement for password and ude the empty paragraphs id here to print if the password is correct or not.
var password = document.getElementById("password").value;
function checkPass() {
    if (password == 12){
        document.getElementById("try").innerHTML = ("Password correct");
    }
    else{
        document.getElementById("try").innerHTML = ("Password incorrect");
    }
    
}
