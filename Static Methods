1. Static methods can be called from a class without having to create a new object of the class.

class IPhone{
    constructor(price, brand, weight){
        this.price = price;
        this.brand = brand;
        this.weight = weight;
    }
    spiel(){
        return `${this.brand} costs ${this.price} in 2019.`;
    }
    static warranty(){
        return 'This phone carries a 3 year warranty with purchase.';
    }
}


// Here we create a new instance of the class above so we can access spiel method we don not need to create a new instance of the 
class above to call warranty as this method is static
let p = new IPhone(233, 'IPhoneX', '2.666Kg');

console.log(p.spiel());
//Below is how we call a static method.
console.log(IPhone.warranty());
