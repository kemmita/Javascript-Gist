1. Parent class

class UserClass {
    constructor(username, email){
        this.username = username;
        this.email = email;
    }

    getBio(){
        return `${this.username} has their email registered as ${this.email}`;
    }
}

2. Child class

//use extends to use inheritance
class Employee extends UserClass{
    constructor(username, email, salary, position){
        super(username, email);
        this.salary = salary;
        this.position = position;
    }
    //simply change the body of the method to override it from the parent.
    getBio() {
        return `${this.username} works as a ${this.position}`;
    }
}

const emp = new Employee('jkemmit', 'jk@yahoo.com', 12.44, 'cAagier');
console.log(emp.getBio());
