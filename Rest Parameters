1. Using rest params allows you to create dynamic functions.

//Using rest params we can pass in as many vars that we want and our function will react appropriatley.
const calcAverage = (...numbers) => {
  let sum = 0;
  numbers.forEach((num) => sum += num);
  return sum/numbers.length;
};
console.log(calcAverage(5,3, 9, 100));

//Below we use a rest param and a normal variable.
const calcAverageAdvanced = (thing, ...numbers) => {
    let sum = 0;
    numbers.forEach((num) => sum += num);
    const mean = sum/numbers.length;
    return `The average ${thing} is ${Math.round(mean)}`;
};

console.log(calcAverageAdvanced('score', 2,1,3,2,2,1));
