1. we are unable to declare a variable in a class like we would do in c or Java for example
int x;
string name;
therefore we need to create getters and setters without making a declartion in the class like below

class data{
    // location variable of class data
    get location (){
        return this._location;
    }
    set location (value){
        return this._location = value;
    }
}

data.location = "St Paul";
console.log(data.location);
