1. Using find we can create the exact same datatype as the element we want to locate in the array.

const getNotes = (title) => {
   //notes is an array
  const notes = loadNotes();
  //Below we search the array that is full of objects, if we find the title, only one object will be assigned 
  // to checkForNote, the object we are looking for
  const checkForNote = notes.find(note => note.title === title);
  // if the object was found we will now have access to its properties. 
  if (checkForNote){
      console.log(`Title: ${checkForNote.title} Body: ${checkForNote.body}`);
  } else {
      console.log(`${title} not found.`);
  }
};
