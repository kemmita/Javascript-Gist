//below we will be setting up an account that will buy items untill the balance has hit 0. balance wilol begin at 1000 and items bought 
will begin at 0. the while loop will have us buying items untill our balance hits 0. On line 5 we need to create a new variable called 
itemPrice have it set to math.floor and then within the parameters of floor set math.random and times it by 100 as random numbers in JS 
tend to be quite small that is the only reasoning behind multipling by 100. then we will need to create an if statement that checks if 
itemPrice is less then or equal to balance, if so that means we have the funds and the next line of code will add and item to our list 
the next line of code minuses the random ammount of that item from our balance and then we have a simple print statement but inside of 
the print staement we create an additional html paragraph, see lines 9 through 10 for reference. we place all of our code inside of a 
function so we can initate the code when a button is pushed. the function name will be used for onclick method inside of button.
function startGame(){
var balance = 1000;
var itemsBought = 0;
while(balance>0){
    var itemPrice = Math.floor(Math.random()*100);
    if(itemPrice <= balance){
        itemsBought += 1;
        balance -= itemPrice;
        document.getElementById("balpar").innerHTML += "<p> Purchase ammount: $" + itemPrice + ". New Balance: " + balance +". <p />";
    }
}
    document.getElementById("balpar").innerHTML += "<p>Items purchased:" + itemsBought +"<p/>"
}
