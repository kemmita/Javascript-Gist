1. We can wrap our js code in a confirm block. This way the user will have to confirm they want to perform the action before it happens.

   if (confirm("are you sure you want to remove this?!")) {
                $.ajax({
                    url: 'process.php',
                    type: 'POST',
                    data: {id: id, deleteCar: deleteCar},
                    success: function () {
                        $('.title-input').val("");
                    }
                });
            }
